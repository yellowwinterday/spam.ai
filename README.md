# Spam.ai

Spam.ai is an AI-based spam detection plugin designed for online discussions, currently supporting platforms such as xenForo, phpBB, Ghost, and WordPress. It's built to provide a superior alternative to traditional spam detection software like Akismet, offering advanced spam detection capabilities at a fraction of the cost.

## Features

## Which LLM?

Spam.ai utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo for its underlying technology, ensuring state-of-the-art spam detection capabilities.

## Who is Using Spam.ai?

All Tapatalk Group forums currently use Spam.ai. In March 2024 alone, it successfully processed and flagged a significant number of posts as spam, showcasing its efficiency and reliability. It is a cost-effective solution for Tapatalk, offering substantial savings.
